# Lending Aggregator

### What Is a Lending Aggregator?

Instead of manually researching and depositing your funds into one protocol, a Lending Aggregator:

* **Aggregates liquidity options across various lending platforms**
* **Routes your deposits to the highest-yielding pool**
* **Manages your positions dynamically to maximize returns**

You simply deposit your assets into Arya, and it does the rest.

***

### How Does It Work?

1. **Unified Access:**\
   Connect to many lending protocols via a single interface.
2. **Real-Time Rate Comparison:**\
   Continuously scan and compare lending rates and incentives across all integrated platforms.
3. **Optimal Routing:**\
   Automatically allocate your funds to the protocol offering the best yield, factoring in gas fees and liquidity.
4. **Ongoing Management:**\
   Monitor changing market conditions and reallocate funds to maintain maximum returns.

### Example Use Case

You want to lend DAI:

* Without an aggregator, you might pick one protocol, missing better yields elsewhere.
* With Arya, your DAI is dynamically routed to the protocol offering the highest interest at that moment, ensuring better returns with no extra work.
