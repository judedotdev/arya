# What is a Yield Optimizer?

A yield optimizer is a smart autopilot for your DeFi assets.

It automatically:
- Finds the best lending yields or lowest borrowing rates across protocols
- Routes your assets to the optimal platform (Aave, Compound, Morpho, etc.)
- Continuously monitors rates and rebalances when better opportunities appear
- Adapts to risk, volatility, liquidity, and gas costs
- Implements sophisticated strategies without manual input

Think of it as: GPS (finding the route) + Autopilot (driving for you) + Traffic Monitor (adjusting in real-time)

Arya is a yield optimizer that combines all these capabilities to maximize your returns while minimizing effort.

## Aggregator vs Optimizer

> Understanding the two engines behind DeFi efficiency — and how Arya merges them.

***

### Aggregator: The Router

An **aggregator** acts like a GPS for your assets.

It doesn’t hold your funds, but it **guides them** to where they’ll earn the most or cost the least — based on current protocol data.

### &#x20;**What It Does:**

* Finds the **best lending yield** or **lowest borrowing rate**
* Routes assets to the most optimal money market (e.g. Aave, Compound, Morpho)
* Avoids manual comparison across platforms

***

### Optimizer: The Strategist

An **optimizer** is more than a GPS — it’s a **smart autopilot** that dynamically adapts.

It not only routes, but also **manages, rebalances, and fine-tunes** your positions based on changing market conditions.

### **What It Does:**

* Monitors yield/borrow rates continuously
* **Auto-rebalances** when better opportunities appear
* Adapts to risk, volatility, protocol liquidity, and gas cost
* Can **implement strategies** (e.g. target yield %, minimum LTV)

### **Key Value:**

* **Reduces user effort**
* **Improves long-term performance**
* Responds in real-time to **market shifts**

### Arya = Aggregator + Optimizer

Arya combines the **routing power of an aggregator** with the **intelligence of an optimizer**.

Rather than choosing between the two, you get the benefits of both:

| Feature                      | Aggregator | Optimizer | **Arya** |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Chooses best APY / APR       | ✅          | ✅         | ✅          |
| Auto-rebalances              | ❌          | ✅         | ✅          |
| Adjusts for gas & volatility | ❌          | ✅         | ✅          |
| Multi-protocol access        | ✅          | ✅         | ✅          |
| Implements smart strategies  | ❌          | ✅         | ✅          |
| Requires manual input        | ✅          | ❌         | ❌          |
