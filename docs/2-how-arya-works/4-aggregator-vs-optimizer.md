# What is a Yield Optimizer?

Understanding the smart autopilot behind Arya's DeFi efficiency.

A yield optimizer is more than a simple router — it's an intelligent system that finds, manages, and adapts your DeFi positions automatically.

Think of it as: GPS (finding the best route) + Autopilot (managing the journey) + Traffic Monitor (adjusting in real-time).

What Arya's Yield Optimizer Does:

Initial Routing
- Finds the best lending yield or lowest borrowing rate
- Routes assets to the optimal money market (e.g. Aave, Compound, Morpho)
- Eliminates manual comparison across platforms

Continuous Management
- Monitors yield/borrow rates across protocols 24/7
- Auto-rebalances when better opportunities appear
- Adapts to risk, volatility, protocol liquidity, and gas costs
- Implements smart strategies (e.g. target yield %, minimum LTV)

Key Benefits:

✓ Zero manual effort — Set it and forget it
✓ Maximized long-term performance — Always earning/borrowing at optimal rates
✓ Real-time adaptation — Responds instantly to market shifts
✓ Multi-protocol access — One interface, all major lending platforms
✓ Gas-optimized — Smart execution minimizes transaction costs

Without a Yield Optimizer:
You manually check rates, withdraw from Protocol A, deposit to Protocol B, pay gas fees, repeat daily.

With Arya:
Your positions automatically move to wherever rates are best — while you sleep.
