# Borrowing Optimizer

### Why Borrowing Optimization Matters

Borrowing rates across protocols fluctuate rapidly. Without an optimization strategy, users risk:

* Paying higher interest than necessary
* Using suboptimal collateral, increasing liquidation risk
* Missing out on cost-saving opportunities
* Struggling with manual position management

The Borrowing Optimizer automates this process, giving you a strategic advantage.

### How It Works — Step by Step

1. **Initial Assessment:**\
   When you initiate a borrow, the optimizer checks all supported protocols and selects the one with the lowest APR and best collateral terms.
2. **Ongoing Surveillance:**\
   It monitors the market continuously for rate changes and collateral requirement updates.
3. **Dynamic Adjustment:**\
   If a better borrowing option becomes available, the optimizer triggers an automated migration of your debt position, factoring in transaction costs and risk.
4. **User Control:**\
   You can set parameters like maximum acceptable APR, preferred collateral types, and rebalance frequency.

### Practical Scenario

Imagine you borrow ETH using your collateralized assets:

* Arya initially routes your debt to Protocol X with a 6% APR.
* The borrowing rate drops to 4.5% on Protocol Y, which also requires less collateral.
* Your debt is automatically migrated to Protocol Y, reducing your interest payments and collateral locked.
