### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

* Visit the Arya app and click **“Connect Wallet.”**
* Choose your preferred wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
* Approve the connection to proceed securely.
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Step 2: Supply Collateral

* Before borrowing, you’ll need to **supply a supported asset** as collateral (e.g., ETH, USDC, WBTC).
* Go to the **Deposit** section, select your asset and amount, and confirm the transaction.
* Your supplied collateral will now be available to secure any borrowing.
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Step 3: Choose Asset to Borrow

* Navigate to the **Borrow** section.
* Select the token you want to borrow from the supported list.
* Arya will automatically show:
  * **Available borrowing capacity**
  * **Lowest borrowing APR** across protocols
  * **Protocol details** (e.g., LTV ratio, liquidation threshold, etc.)
    {% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Step 4: Review and Confirm

* Enter the amount you wish to borrow.
* Review important borrowing metrics:
  * **Estimated interest rate**
  * **Health factor**
  * **Collateral ratio**
  * **Gas fees**
* Click **“Borrow”** and confirm the transaction in your wallet.
  {% endstep %}

{% step %}

### Step 5: Track and Manage Your Position

* After borrowing, your position will be visible in the **dashboard**, where you can:
  * Monitor interest accrual
  * Adjust your collateral or repay debt
  * Enable auto-migration (optional) if better rates become available
  * View health factor alerts in real-time
    {% endstep %}
    {% endstepper %}
