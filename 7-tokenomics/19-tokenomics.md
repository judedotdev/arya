# Tokenomics

Arya is building a resilient, community-first money market aggregator and optimizer. This section outlines the full $ARYA tokenomics model, reward system, and Token Generation Event (TGE) mechanics.

### $ARYA Points Program

The Arya Points Program fairly distributes **1,000,000 $ARYA tokens** (worth **$1,000,000 at launch**) over a **3-month incentive season**.

* **Daily Emission**: 11,111.11 $ARYA
* **Earning Logic**: Based on your share of platform TVL
* **Redemption**: 1 point = 1 $ARYA token (1:1 ratio)
* **Conversion Option**: Redeem points for **USDC at a 50% discount** any time before season ends

At the end of the season:

* Token Generation Event (TGE) will occur
* $800K liquidity added to Shadow (v2 pool, 50/50 USDC/$ARYA)
* Users can then buy/sell $ARYA freely on the market at 1% Fee

### Token Allocation

| **Category**              | **Allocation** | **Tokens** | **Notes**                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| User Incentives           | 60%            | 3,000,000  | 8 seasons: S1 = 20%, S2–S8 = 5.71% each             |
| Private Round(Raised 1m$) | 25%            | 1,000,000  | 6 month cliff, followed by 24 month linear vesting  |
| Liquidity Bootstrapping   | 3%             | 150,000    | For DEX protocol-owned liquidity (POL)              |
| Team                      | 12%            | 600,000    | 12-month cliff, followed by 24-month linear vesting |

### Voting via Gauge System (veARYA Model)

Arya adopts a **gauge-style voting model** (inspired by ve(3,3)). Token holders who lock $ARYA as **veARYA** can vote on which lending protocols the assets are deployed into

#### How It Works:

* Users lock $ARYA for **veARYA** (voting escrow)
* Weekly votes are cast to direct assets into specific lending protocols
* A protocol cannot receive more than 25% of total asset TVL
* **All protocol fees** (interest, origination fees,Bribes etc.) from a market are distributed to voters who supported that market

#### Benefits:

* Aligns point emissions with **highest demand pools and protocols**
* Promotes **long-term protocol alignment**
* Enables **bribe markets and vote marketplaces** in future

### TGE (Token Generation Event)

The **TGE** launches immediately after **Season 1 ends**.

* Users claim earned $ARYA tokens
* **$800K liquidity** deployed on Shadow in a **50/50 USDC/$ARYA** v2 pool
* $ARYA Season 2 Begins
