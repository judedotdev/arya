# $ARYA Points

### Incentivizing Participation With Transparent Rewards

The **Arya Points Program** is a time-bound incentive initiative designed to reward early users and contributors with a fair share of the upcoming $ARYA token supply in return for bootstrapping the Arya protocol. This mechanism ensures that participation in the protocol directly translates into token ownership — with no hidden formulas or subjective criteria.

***

### Overview

* **Total Reward Pool:** 1,000,000 $ARYA
* **Estimated Launch Value:** $1,000,000
* **Duration:** 3 months
* **Daily Emission:** 11,111.11 points/day
* **Conversion Rate:** 1 point = 1 $ARYA

Every day, 11,111.11 points are distributed proportionally to users based on their share of the protocol's Total Value Locked (TVL). The more capital you contribute to the platform, the more points — and thus $ARYA — you earn.

***

### How It Works

#### 1. Earn Points Passively

* Points are calculated based on your **TVL share** relative to all users.
* Rewards accrue **daily and automatically**, with no manual actions required.

#### 2. Claim $ARYA at TGE

* At the end of the season, the **Token Generation Event (TGE)** takes place.
* Each point you've earned becomes **redeemable for 1 $ARYA token**.

> **Example:** If you earned 10,000 points, you’ll receive 10,000 $ARYA.

***

### Optional Early Exit: Convert to USDC

To reduce token sell pressure post-launch, an early claim option is available:

* At any point during the season, you can **redeem your points for USDC which is claimable at the season end**.
* The conversion rate is **50% of the launch value**.
* This means each point can be exchanged for **$0.50 USDC** before the season ends.

> This provides liquidity to users who prefer immediate returns or stable assets.

***

### Post-TGE Liquidity

After the season closes:

* $ARYA becomes **tradable** on the open market.
* **$800,000 in liquidity** will be added to a **v2 pool on Shadow**.
* Users can buy, sell, or LP $ARYA via the Shadow DEX.

This ensures a robust and accessible market for all participants.
