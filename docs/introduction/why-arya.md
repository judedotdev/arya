# Why Arya?

### The Arya Advantage

Arya abstracts away the fragmented, inefficient experience and offers:

**Unified Access to DeFi Markets**

Access multiple money markets from a **single dashboard** — no need to navigate across Aave, Silo or Euler separately.

**Auto-Migrating Positions**

Your lending or borrowing positions are **automatically rebalanced** when better rates are available elsewhere — with zero manual input.

**Maximum Yield for Depositors**

Your idle assets are always deployed to the **highest-yielding protocol**, ensuring you never miss out on better returns.

**Lowest Borrowing Cost for Debtors**

Borrow assets at the **lowest available APR**, with optimized collateral selection and liquidation thresholds.

**Intelligent Automation**

Arya uses a smart optimization engine to handle:

* Rate monitoring
* Rebalancing
* Risk assessments
* Strategy switching

All in real-time.

**Modular, Composable Design**

Easily integrate with new DeFi protocols or plug Arya into your own app using SDKs and APIs.
