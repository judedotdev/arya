# Who is it For?

### 1. The Passive Earner

> *“I just want to earn the best yield on my crypto — without checking every protocol.”*

* **Problem:** Too many platforms, too many APYs, too much monitoring.
* **Just Use Arya**

***

### 2. The Cost-Conscious Borrower

> *“I need to borrow, but I want the lowest rates and safest terms.”*

* **Problem:** Borrow rates vary wildly. Risk of liquidation. Complex interfaces.
* **Just use Arya**

***

### 3. The Institutional Capital Allocator

> *“I manage large portfolios. I need scalability, security, and performance.”*

* **Problem:** Manual DeFi operations don’t scale. Protocols behave differently.
* **Just Use Arya**

***

### 4. The DeFi App Builder

> *“I’m building a wallet, dashboard, or yield product. I need composability.”*

* **Problem:** Every DeFi protocol has different logic and APIs.
* **Just Use Arya**
