# Managing Collateral

### What Is Collateral in DeFi?

Collateral is the asset you deposit to secure a loan. If the value of your collateral drops too low relative to your borrowed amount, your position may be **liquidated**.

With Arya, you can:

* Deposit multiple assets as collateral
* Adjust collateral at any time
* Monitor risk in real time
* Set up alerts or automate responses

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**   | % of your collateral's value that you can borrow                     |
| **Liquidation Threshold** | Point at which your position becomes vulnerable to liquidation       |
| **Health Factor**         | Safety score of your position; above 1.0 is safe, below 1.0 is risky |
